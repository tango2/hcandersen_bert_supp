<h3>Abstract:</h2>

<body>H.C. Andersen is best known for his literary fairy tales. Not surprisingly, critical literary scholarship on Andersen has focused predominantly on this corpus. His travel writings which, taken as a whole, constitute a considerable component of his diverse authorship, are less well-known but provide important insight into how Andersen viewed the world, the concepts that he found particularly engaging, and his developing understanding of the individual and the relationship between the spiritual and the physical worlds. Our goal is to provide a small correction to the critical siloing of Andersen's diverse literary production by exploring the fairy tales and travel writing as interdependent aspects of Andersenâ€™s broader authorship. We place particular emphasis on the vocabulary of the two corpuses and explore the shared topic spaces within the tales and travel writing, the changing interdependence in the topics across genres, and consider novel groupings of fairy tales based on this shared topic space. We rely on a novel topic modeling method that leverages large language models (LLMs) and couple this to well-established network methods for graph partitioning and clustering, identifying  the networks of topics that create communities of tales and travel writing.</body>
